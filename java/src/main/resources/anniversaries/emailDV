Hello Daniel.

I've prepared a Java demo "ANNIVERSARIES" for your party NULL SYMBOL #1.
Since the party is in the beginning of a new year, the demo presents interesting events that have their anniversary in 2026.
It's on my Github account and can be easily downloaded at:
https://github.com/kdrzazga/misc-graphics/releases/download/anniversaries/anniversaries.jar

No worries - retro fans don't visit this place.
Once you download, let me know, and I'll hide the binary till the end of your compo party.
Demo runs in fullscreen mode and can be (obviously) run with command:

java -jar anniversaries.jar

If for some reason, like recording, you'd like to have it ran in window mode, use:

java -jar anniversaries.jar window

Application was compiled with java 11, and runs without problems at Java 24 and Windows 11.

Pls kindly confirm reception, and enjoy :)

BR,
KD
