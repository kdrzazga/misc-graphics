As the pixels glow and melodies play, we celebrate the magic of nostalgic day. From Commodore’s heart to modern PC’s glow, your art and code make the spirits flow.

Through retro screens and vibrant hues, you craft a world where dreams come true. Chiptunes dance like silent snow, in every byte, your passions grow.

May this festive season bring you joy anew, With inspiration shining bright and true. Let’s toast to the coders, graphicians, and sound, in this demo-scene realm, where magic’s found.

So as the year draws to its close, and Christmas whispers softly, doze— Wishing you warmth, peace, and cheer, and 'Frohe Weinachten', my friends, so dear!
