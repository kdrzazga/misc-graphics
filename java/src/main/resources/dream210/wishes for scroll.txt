As the pixels glow and melodies play, we celebrate the magic of nostalgic day. From Commodore’s heart to modern PC’s glow, your art and code make the spirits flow.

Through retro screens and vibrant hues, you craft a world where dreams come true. Chiptunes dance like silent snow. In every byte, your passions grow.

May this festive season bring you joy anew, with inspiration shining bright and true. Toast to creators of code, picture, sound in this scene realm, where magic’s found.

As the year comes to a gentle close, and Christmas softly glows, I wish you warmth, peace, and cheer, with heartfelt joy this time of year! 'Frohe Weihnachten' my friends so dear, may happiness and love appear!
